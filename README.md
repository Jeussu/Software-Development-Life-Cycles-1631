# Software-Development-Life-Cycles-1631
Introduction 
This report will discuss and evaluate 4 development software development models. Feasibility analysis, risk identification and evaluation of technical solutions. 
Software Development Life Cycle Model (SDLC)  
Original Waterfall Model 
The waterfall model is an example of a Sequential model. In this model, software development activities are divided into different stages and each stage consists of a series of tasks and has different goals.

(ALAN, DENNIS; BARBARA, HALEY WIXOM; ROBERTA, M. ROTH, 2012,p51) 
Basic Principle of Original Waterfall model 
- Based on the waterfall model and these methods, the terms of software development require that the transition from one production stage to another occurs only after the previous stage is completed. There is no phase overlap. Budget and time are strictly fixed and managed. 
The deployment of Waterfall model includes the following development stages: 
•	Request analysis 
•	Design 
•	Develop 
•	Check 
•	Operation (Maintenance). 
The listed periods are performed in sequential order, and the results obtained are recorded. The change in finished function only occurs after reaching the user. The end of each period. Each stage after approval, The phase ends and the next phase will be started. 
Advantage: 
1.	Simple model easy to implement. 
2.	Easy to distribute and monitor work. 
3.	The tasks remain as stable as possible throughout the development process. 
Disadvantages: 
-	Not flexible: Waterfalls do not respond to changes. When the specification request phase is locked in all planned features, the project will continue until its completion. 
-	Easily congested and delayed: If a problem is detected at a later stage, such as during development or testing, this affects the entire process flow because the stages are quite sequential. and it may cause significant delays. 
-	Delayed product delivery: Only the completion of the final stages of a software project provides a deliverable product. (Tal, Liran, 2015) 
V	- shape Model 
Vmodel is an extension of the waterfall model. Unlike waterfall model. In the V model, corresponding to a test phase is a software development stage, testing in the V-model is conducted in parallel with the software development cycle.

( shwetarawat620, ShubhamNerkar, 2019) 
According to the V model, the model's operating process will begin to descend from the left of V, the process begins with the analysis and identification of requirements to design the components of the system. At the bottom of the V system, the process will execute code. Next, the process will go up the right slope of V. Each of the following stages of the process is each test procedure, from component testing, integration testing to finally system testing. 
1. Advantages: 
-	The development process and management process are organized and systematic - Works well for small and medium sized projects. 
-	Testing starts from the beginning of development so ambiguity is determined from the beginning. 
-	Easy to manage because each stage has clearly defined goals and objectives. 
2. Disadvantages: 
-	Not suitable for large and complex projects 
-	Not suitable if requirements frequently change. 
-	No working software is produced in the intermediate stage. 
-	There is no provision for risk analysis so there is uncertainty and risk. 
• Spiral Model 
Spiral model is a model combining features of prototyping and waterfall models. The spiral model is preferred for large, expensive and complex projects. This model uses many of the same stages as the waterfall model, in order, plan, risk assessment, ... 
Advantages: 
-	Estimates (i.e. budget, schedule, etc.) become more realistic as a workflow, because important issues were discovered earlier. 
-	There is early participation of developers 
-	Risk management and system development in phases Disadvantages: 
-	High cost and long time to have the final product 
-	Must have good skills to assess risks and assumptions. 
• Agile model 
Agile is a flexible software development method to bring products to users as quickly as possible and is considered an improvement over the old models such as the "waterfall" model or "CMMI". Agile software development method is a set of iterative and incremental development methods in which requirements and solutions are developed through collaborative links between autonomous and inter-functional groups.

Advantages 
-	Strengthen teamwork spirit and effective work exchange. 
-	The function is built quickly and clearly, cricket management. 
-	Easy to add, change requests. 
-	Minimal rules, easy to understand documents, easy to use. Disadvantages 
-	Agile model is widely used in the world but is not synonymous with suitable for all software projects. 
-	Not suitable for handling complex dependencies. 
-	There are many risks of sustainability, maintainability, and scalability. 
-	Need an experienced team. 
-	Depends greatly on the clear interaction of customers. 
-	Transferring technology to new team members can be difficult due to the lack of documentation. 
Prototyping model 
Prototyping model A system development method in which a model model is built, tested, and then rebuilt as necessary until an acceptable model model is obtained, from this model, A complete system or product may be developed.

Advantages 
-	Favorable for early change in system development. 
-	Opportunity to stop system development if not feasible 
-	Develop the system close to the requirements and hopes of the user Disadvantages 
-	Difficulties in management and development for large projects. 
-	Users and analysts can accept the template as a complete system when in fact it is not enough and cannot serve as a complete system. 
Choose the right method to apply to Tune Source 
I think this project should apply the waterfall model to implement the Tune Source project. Because this project has very clear requirements, new features are easy to use, not complicated. And I'm sure this Tune Source project won't be risky. 
 
Software risk management 
A theory, the final element of project management is risk management, this process includes assessing and addressing the risks involved in developing a project. Causes of risks: Lack of technically trained human resources, Risks from customers, Unclear requirements, Personnel leaving the project, many external decisions affecting the project, Performance not guaranteed. In short, software risk management is identifying, analyzing, evaluating and providing measures for possible risks to prevent and mitigate risks before they become a threat to software. software development project activities.

Feasibility Study 
In case the system proposal is accepted by the organization, the next stage is to check the feasibility of the system. A feasibility study is basically a proposed system test based on its performance, responding to user requests, and assessing project-related risks. The main goal of a feasibility study is not to solve the problem but to reach the scope. During the feasibility study, costs and benefits were estimated with greater accuracy to find Return on Investment (ROI). This also identifies the resources needed to complete the detailed investigation. The result is a feasibility report submitted to the organization. This may be accepted or accepted with modification or rejection. Techniques assessed in a report cover the following areas: 
-	Economic feasibility - Benefits that are likely to exceed the cost of problem solving are often expressed by cost / benefit analysis. 
-	Feasibility in operation 
-	Feasibility of the organization 
-	Technical feasibility 
-	Social feasibility 
In the feasibility study when executing a project of this music company, there are risks from the customer, for example: The customer requested to put the song on the system and prepare payment procedures for a reason. some unwarranted people leave for no reason, thus greatly affecting the cost and feasibility of their operations. 
Technical Feasibility 
Technical feasibility analysis is the process of technical risk analysis. In order to assess the technical feasibility most important is the customer's request to the user or analytics application. When analysts do not understand and understand user requirements, it can be misleading between customers and analysts or miss opportunities that are potential customers and increase project risk. In addition, when users and customers do not make clear requirements, it will increase the risk and the risk of damage. 
Understandably, when a company undertakes a project that helps them develop music software for Tune Source requirements specified in the system requirements, there is a higher risk than just upgrading and expand the old system. For example, Viettel telecom group applies 5g network technology in Vietnam, this has many benefits on its financial capacity, which can be risky because this is a new type of telecommunications technology. is the most compatible device in the world and not yet compatible with many phones in Vietnam. Second, technological familiarity is also another important potential technical risk. When an enterprise uses new technology that has not been used before, it brings a lot of risks and potential harm to the project progress by learning how to get used to new technology. Next is the size of the project that needs to be discussed. when a company implements large-scale projects with higher risks because they are more complicated to manage, for example, financial management is essential for project completion or auditing. checking the number of features in the system is not easy. New technology is needed and depends on the data of the old system to operate. 
Technical feasibility in Tune Source Project  
Familiarity with the application and technology 
According to the Scenario System, currently Tune Tune Source has a website that allows customers to search and buy digital music. This software was originally developed by an ABC company and is hosted by a vendor. The online music search and sale service provided by the famous ABC company Tune Source has become experienced in developing software with Internet technology when they work with ISPs. to maintain the site. Software support and website to search and buy individual download tracks for a fixed fee per download. But in terms of downloading music and storing digital music, customers still have difficulty with the IT department because they have to get used to the new system. Because Tune Source was previously only experienced in selling physical CDs, besides developing a new system, Tune Source was able to increase sales, develop more and compete with other companies. 
Project size 
The project is not too big, the new system is not too difficult because this project has very clear requirements, new features easy to use, not complicated. 
Compatibility 
Good compatibility because the website and music selling software are developed by ABC technology company and hosted by the world famous IT department. 
Economic feasibility 
For any system, if the expected benefit is equal to or exceeds the expected cost, the system can be judged economically feasible. In economic feasibility, cost benefit analysis is performed in which costs and expected benefits are assessed. Economic analysis is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. 
- In economic feasibility, the most important is cost benefit analysis. As the name suggests, it is an analysis of the costs incurred in the system and the benefits derived from the system. Steps overall assessment of economic feasibility:

Economic feasibility in Tune Source Project 
The financial viability of the project is high, because when implementing the project the estimated revenue for each sale method is: 
•	$ 757,500 in revenue from individual music downloads 
•	$ 950,000 in revenue from customer subscriptions 
•	$ 205,000 when selling additional CDs at the store or website 
•	Sales of $ 153,000 from gift cards downloading music. 
With each function of the system, it will meet the needs of customers, in addition to sponsors and reputation will collect capital for the company. 
Organizational Feasibility 
The final technique used for feasibility analysis is to assess the organizational feasibility of the system: how well the system ultimately will be accepted by its users and incorporated into the ongoing operations of the organization. The evaluation of an organization's feasibility is to consider the objectives of the project so that it is suitable with the business strategy's capacity and from which the project will face less risk. Many projects are scrapped or terminated for inappropriate and unprofitable goals. Next assess the feasibility of an organization through stakeholder analysis. “A stakeholder is a person, group or organization that can influence (or may be affected by) a new system. In general, the most important stakeholders in introducing a new system are project champions, system users, and organizational management, but the system sometimes affects other stakeholders.” (Alan Dennis, Barbara Haley Wixom, Roberta M. Roth, 2018) 
Organizational feasibility in Tune Source Project 
High feasibility because the features of the project are required by users, the project goal will bring high profits in accordance with the company's strategic goals. 
Technical solutions 
In this section, we discuss how to choose a strategy to deploy the system. There are 3 ways to implement the system: Custom Development, Packaged Software, and Outsourcing 
Custom development 
Many project teams think that custom development or building a new system from scratch is the best way to create a new system. For one, teams have full control over how the system and functions. Let's consider the purchasing process for Tune Source. If the company wants a Web-based feature closely linked to the existing CD sales system, the project may include a complex, highly specialized program. In addition, Tune Source may have a professional technical environment in which all information systems are built from standard technology and interface design to be more suitable and easier to update and support. . In both cases, it can be very effective to create a new system from scratch that meets these highly specialized requirements. When developers don't find an outdated solution or solution, custom development is a good choice. Custom development allows developers more flexibility and innovative solutions. In addition, developing custom applications requires hard work 
Packaged Software 
Currently, many software buying organizations have been developed, instead of developing their own custom solutions. This is also considered a rapid and effective development step for system development. With the need that Tune Source will add to the project, it is easy, fast and flexible to provide digital music purchased over the Internet to buyers. Some problems that may be encountered when using the bundled software: The company may have to accept that the bundled software may be similar to other companies. 
Out – sourcing 
Another option would be to hire an external provider, developer or service provider to create or provide the system. Outsourcing companies called application service providers (ASPs) provide software applications and Internet-related services. With this solution, the company will save the cost of hiring employees to implement the project. The solution also has some disadvantages such as security and data theft through sourcing, managing this risk by carefully examining contracts, not hiring untrusted contracts.
